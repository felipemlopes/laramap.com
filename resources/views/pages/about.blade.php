                <h4>What is Laramap?</h4>
                <p>Laramap.com is an interactive map for artisans all over the world. Laravel has become one of the biggest communities of fans, contributors and backers worldwide.</p>

                <h4>Why was Laramap.com made</h4>
                <p>Laramap.com was made because since the release of Laramap, there wasn´t any website for mapping "artisans", collecting resources and creating tutorials by users outside their blog / websites they own. So it was clear for me to create such a service.</p>

                <h4>Can i support Laramap?</h4>
                <p>Yes - you can! Serving this website does cost money. It´s built on services that are not free. If you wan´t to support Laramap.com you can simply drop me a line on the contactform or subscribe to a "Sponsoring-Plan". Becoming a partner is also possible.</p>
